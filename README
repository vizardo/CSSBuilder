This is a Java GUI application that helps web designers and web-app developers to easily create a cascading style sheet through a click-and-select type interface. It is done as a course-related project that I did in College.It incorporates various graphical interface elements such as windows, panels, drop-down lists, check-boxes, text areas, sliders etc. provided by Java Swing API. The application will let the user select various elements, classes, id values and their properties from front-end and write that data to a style sheet file.
The application will have the basic operation of building a CSS file from scratch, which creates an all-new CSS file without linking it to an html page. The user can add styling for various HTML elements, ids and classes. The aim is to minimize typing. Ideally, only id and class names will have to be typed in. The program will let the user select html elements from a drop-down, or create id names or classes and then add various property-value pairs to them. The properties will be accompanied by a suitable interface that will let the user easily configure its value graphically, eliminating the typing process wherever possible.
The final product may contain some additional features like creating a CSS file for an existing HTML file, generated by parsing it and listing out all existing tags, id and class names and letting the user style them as explained earlier.
The biggest technical concern is presenting user with relevant data picked up from property files in drop-down lists and through other graphical interface elements. Picking up user input and selections and storing them in collection objects until file-write is also a bridge that need to be crossed. Also, the sheer volume of coding that need to be done is a major concern, which has forced me to limit the features of the program.
